# ShopSense — Vendor Marketplace Intelligence Platform

ShopSense is a full-stack vendor marketplace and business intelligence platform. Vendors register, manage their product catalog, and access a complete suite of analytics, demand forecasting, customer segmentation, and AI-powered shopping assistance — all from a single, unified interface.

---

## Overview

ShopSense combines a live vendor catalog management system with deep analytics drawn from a historical dataset of 10,000+ products, 5,000+ customers, and real transaction history. The platform is designed to feel like one cohesive product rather than a collection of individual features.

## Setup

### 1. Install backend dependencies (one time)

From the repository root:

```powershell
py -3 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r analytics_api\requirements-dev.txt
```

On macOS/Linux, create and use `.venv` with `python3 -m venv .venv`.

### 2. Configure email and start the backend

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
# Edit .env with real SMTP credentials and a strong JWT_SECRET.
npm run dev
```

This starts the Python API at `http://localhost:8000`; no Node/Express backend is used. The API initializes SQLite on first run and imports the historical XLSX dataset.

Configure `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USERNAME`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, and `SMTP_FROM_EMAIL` in the root `.env`. Root `.env` values take precedence over legacy `server/.env` values. Gmail requires an app password; do not put credentials in frontend code or commit them.

To create the first administrator, set `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_NAME`, and a unique `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env`, then call the one-time bootstrap endpoint:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri http://localhost:8000/api/auth/bootstrap-admin
```

The administrator must verify that mailbox before signing in. New vendor applications also require email verification before admin approval. Existing accounts are marked unverified during migration; their owners must use the sign-in page’s resend-verification flow. There are no shared demo credentials.

To run the Python API in Docker:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

Docker Compose runs the single Python backend and persists its SQLite database and uploads.

### 3. Start the full local app

After installing backend and frontend dependencies and configuring `.env`, start both services from the repository root:

```powershell
npm run local
```

This runs the FastAPI backend and Vite frontend together. Open the frontend URL printed by Vite (normally `http://localhost:5173`). Keep the terminal open while using the app; press `Ctrl+C` to stop both services.

To run only the backend, use `npm run dev`. To run only the frontend, use the commands below in a separate terminal.

### 4. Frontend only

From the repository root in a new terminal:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Starts the app on `http://localhost:5173`. API calls to `/api/*` are proxied to the backend automatically via Vite config.
For local development, leave `VITE_API_URL` unset so browser requests stay same-origin and Vite forwards `/api` and `/uploads` to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. If the frontend and API are deployed separately, set `VITE_API_URL` in the frontend hosting environment to the deployed API URL ending in `/api`.

The API and frontend are separate processes: keep `npm run dev` running in the repository root and `npm run dev` running in `client`. Confirm the API responds at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health` before testing the UI.

### 4. AI Provider (Optional)

Set one of these environment variables in `server/.env` to enable LLM-generated answer synthesis over retrieved catalog products. Python loads the same `server/.env` for local use; Docker Compose reads the root `.env.example`. Retrieval, stock/price filters, product cards, and source data remain grounded in the authenticated vendor's live catalog. Without a provider key (or if a provider is unavailable), the Python service uses its local grounded response generator.

```env
# Google Gemini (recommended)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# OR OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# JWT secret (override default dev secret in production)
JWT_SECRET=your_production_secret_here
```

---

## Environment Variables

| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Optional | Google Gemini API key for LLM generation |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Optional | OpenAI API key (used if Gemini not configured) |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | Optional | Legacy alias for `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Recommended | JWT signing secret (defaults to dev value) |
| `PYTHON_API_PORT` | Optional | Python API port (defaults to 8000) |
| `CLIENT_ORIGIN` | Optional | Additional CORS origin for production deploys |
| `DB_PATH` | Optional | SQLite database path |
| `SMTP_HOST` | Required for registration | SMTP mail server host |
| `SMTP_PORT` | Required for registration | SMTP port (587 with STARTTLS; 465 with SSL) |
| `SMTP_USERNAME` | Required for registration | SMTP account username |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | Required for registration | SMTP account password/app password |
| `SMTP_FROM_EMAIL` | Required for registration | Verified sender address |
| `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` | Initial setup | Email address for the first administrator |
| `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Initial setup | Unique 12-72 byte password for the first administrator |

## Vendor Experience

Vendors access a full business management suite after approval:

**Dashboard** — Business overview: total sales, revenue, transactions, and products listed. Recent product table with images, categories, prices, and stock.

**My Catalog** — Full product CRUD: list, add, edit, delete, adjust stock. Product images via URL or file upload. Low-stock badge indicators.

**Add / Edit Product** — Name, description, category, price, stock, image. Autocomplete suggestions drawn from catalog history.

**Insights** — Complete business intelligence suite (see Analytics & Reporting below).

**AI Shopping Assistant** — RAG-powered catalog search and product discovery (see AI Shopping Assistant below).

**Profile** — Edit account information, change password, view approval status.

---

## Admin Experience

**Admin Dashboard** — Total, pending, approved, and suspended vendor counts with recent registration table.

**Vendor Management** — Filter by status, approve, suspend, or reactivate any vendor account.

---

## Analytics & Reporting

All analytics are computed from real SQLite data. No mock or placeholder values.

### Business Overview

High-level KPIs from the historical dataset: total orders, total revenue, products sold, customer count, average order value.

### Sales & Reporting

Sales and revenue timeseries with day / week / month timeframe controls. Supports two scopes:

- **Vendor** — Live sales transactions from the vendor's own catalog
- **Marketplace** — Historical dataset (10,000+ products, 5,000+ orders)

Interactive SVG spline chart with Revenue, Units Sold, Orders, and Average Order Value metric toggles. Hover tooltips showing exact values per data point.

### Performance Benchmark

Compares the authenticated vendor against the marketplace average across all approved vendors:

| Metric | Vendor Value | Marketplace Average | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total Revenue | ₹X,XXX | ₹X,XXX | +/-X.X% |
| Total Orders | X | X | +/-X.X% |
| Units Sold | X | X | +/-X.X% |
| Products Listed | X | X | +/-X.X% |

Each metric shows above/below/equal status with a relative performance bar. Strategic insights are generated based on actual comparisons.

### Inventory Intelligence

Live stock status for every catalog product with configurable low-stock and medium-stock thresholds. Summary counts: healthy, low-stock, out-of-stock.

### Customer Insights

5,000 historical customers segmented into three spending tiers based on total purchase value:

- **High Value (VIP)** — Top spending customers, total revenue share, average spend
- **Medium Value** — Mid-tier customers
- **Low Value** — Entry-level customers

Searchable customer table with tier filter.

### Product Intelligence

Bestselling products ranked by units sold and revenue. Supports vendor scope (live sales) and marketplace scope (historical dataset). Category filter and configurable result limit.

### Demand Forecast

Interactive stock depletion simulation for any product in the 10,000-item catalog:

- Daily sales velocity from historical order data
- Projected demand over 7 / 14 / 30 / 60 / 90-day horizons
- Stock runout date calculation
- Recommended reorder quantity
- SVG trajectory chart: stock depletion vs cumulative demand
- Category-average velocity fallback when product-specific history is insufficient

### Cross-Sell Intelligence

Market basket analysis from actual transaction data:

- **Frequently Bought Together** — Product and category pair co-purchase patterns with support metrics
- **Association Rules** — Directional purchase relationships (If X → Then Y) with support and confidence
- **Cross-Sell Recommendations** — Rule-based suggestions generated from co-purchase evidence

Configurable minimum support and confidence thresholds.

### Dataset Validation

Live audit comparing imported SQLite table row counts against source XLSX workbook totals. Displays passed/failed status per dataset.

---

## CSV Export

| Export | Endpoint | Columns |
|---|---|---|
| Sales Report | `GET /api/analytics/export/sales` | Date, Product, Category, Quantity, Price, Revenue, Vendor |
| Products Report | `GET /api/analytics/export/products` | ProductID, Name, Category, Price, Stock, UnitsSold, Revenue, Vendor |

Both endpoints support `?scope=vendor` (live vendor sales) or `?scope=marketplace` (full historical dataset). Files are streamed with correct `Content-Type: text/csv` and `Content-Disposition` headers.

---
## AI Shopping Assistant

ShopSense's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant runs in the Python FastAPI service. It searches the authenticated vendor's live product catalog, applies hard price/category/stock filters, and can use Gemini or OpenAI to synthesize a concise answer from the retrieved records. Without an external provider, Python generates a grounded local response.

### RAG Architecture

```
User Question
      │
      ▼
[1] Intent & Constraint Extraction
    • Price: under / above / between / range
    • Category: Electronics, Audio, Computers, Accessories, Wearables, Fashion, Beauty, Home & Kitchen
    • Stock: in-stock / out-of-stock
    • Ordering: cheapest / most expensive / popular
    • Follow-up context: last 2 conversation turns
      │
      ▼
[2] Python Vendor-Scoped Hybrid Retrieval
    • Stable 128-dimensional hashed token and character n-gram vectors
    • Category-aware cosine similarity and exact token/name overlap
    • Retrieves only the authenticated vendor's live products
      │
      ▼
[3] Hard Constraint Filtering
    • Price ceiling: disqualify products above maxPrice
    • Price floor: disqualify products below minPrice
    • In-stock: disqualify stock ≤ 0
    • Out-of-stock: disqualify stock > 0
    • If zero valid results: reports that no products meet the requested filters
      │
      ▼
[4] Popularity & Price Ranking
    • Popular queries: sort by unitsSold from the vendor's live sales records
    • Cheapest: narrow to category (if specified), then sort price ascending
    • Most expensive: sort price descending
    • Standard: cosine similarity + token overlap score
      │
      ▼
[5] Context Construction
    • Up to 6 vendor products supplied to the Python answer generator
    • Context includes retrieved product fields and vendor sales history when available
    • Product cards and source citations are built separately from verified retrieved records
      │
      ▼
[6] LLM Generation (Gemini → OpenAI → Local Fallback)
    • Strict grounding rules: only reference retrieved products; catalog and user text are treated as untrusted data
    • Never invent prices, specs, ratings, reviews, or popularity claims
    • Spec queries (best for video editing / gaming) trigger honest limitation note
    • Local grounded response fallback works without an external provider
      │
      ▼
Answer + Grounded Product Cards + Source Citations
```

### Knowledge Source

| Source | Table | Products |
|---|---|---|
| Live vendor catalog | `products` | Variable (active vendor listings) |
| Popularity data | `sales` joined to `products` | Live sales for the vendor's own products |

Historical analytics workbooks power the BI dashboards, but are not mixed into the vendor assistant's catalog retrieval. This prevents it from recommending products that the vendor does not actually list.

### Catalog Data Limitations

The live vendor catalog may not include technical attributes such as CPU, RAM, GPU, or battery life. The assistant communicates these limitations instead of inventing specifications.

When a query cannot be answered from available data (e.g., "best laptop for video editing" when no specs are listed), the assistant explains the limitation and only shows relevant retrieved products.

### Vector Store

- Python computes stable 128-dimensional hashed token and character n-gram vectors
- Cosine similarity is combined with lexical, product-name, and category matching
- Retrieval reads live SQLite rows on every query, so edits and stock changes are immediately reflected
- No external vector database or stale in-memory index is required

### Live Catalog Updates

The Python retriever queries current SQLite rows for every assistant request, so no manual embedding-index refresh is needed after a product create, edit, stock change, or deletion. Administrators can check the current catalog count with `POST /api/ai/refresh-index`.

### Conversation Context

The assistant supports lightweight follow-up queries. The frontend sends the last 2 AI response product lists as context. This allows questions like "Which is the cheapest?" to resolve correctly after "Show me laptops."

## Authentication & Security

- Registration and login are handled by FastAPI; JavaScript is used for the React frontend only
- Email ownership must be verified through a time-limited email link before login
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- Stateless JWT authentication with 7-day validity
- Role-based access control: `vendor` and `admin` roles enforced by Python dependencies
- Strict vendor data isolation: vendors can only read and modify their own catalog and sales data
- AI API keys stored in environment variables only — never in frontend code or committed to source control
- Input validation on all endpoints: negative stock, malformed prices, oversized requests all rejected
- Email verification tokens are stored as hashes, expire after 30 minutes, and are invalidated when reissued

---

## Testing

Run the Python test suites from the repository root:

```bash
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q analytics_api
```

The suite covers authentication/email verification, Python AI/RAG behavior, and migrated API routers.
